The aim of this workload is to install power automate silently, then install PAC (power automate cli), then  via the second script downlaod the flow files/zip into the taget pc 

and utilize the pac auth create command to log into target power automate service and import the downloaded zip into that service. 

YOU HAVE TO HAVE  A TRIAL VERSION OF POWER AUTOMATE DESKTOP APP FOR THE IMPORT SCRIPT TO WORK, OTHERWISE IT WONT WORK


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  first  modify the import-flow-zip-file.ps1 file and push it it to github


make sure to check the zip file, it contains the flows related files but you cannot access them easily 

change  the username and password in import-flow-zip-file.ps1 file


2) login to power automate on browser  using ACG account

right click on the settings icon on the top right

then click on 'view my licenses', most of them would be crossed out you would not have the RPA trial there yet

then go to left side panel and click my flows 

then do to desktop flows and click start trial, now if you to go 'view my licenses' on th seettings you have have the this RPA license 'Power Automate Plan 2 Trial'



3) create vm and go inisde  vm 

install power automate extension on edge brwoser, you  might even get a automatic prompt

then open power automate desktop app, then clcik settings icon on top right, then uncheck "disable display confrmation diaglog"

make sure to turn on trial version isnide  power automate desktop app, otherwise the import script wont wokr and wont capture details into json (this is optional/another way since you have alredy achieved this in abouve section 2)


4) exuete the second import sceond script -import-flow-zip-file.ps1


5) in the same power automate desktop app, on top, chnage envrionent to "target-env"


6) go to desktop flows, your flow would be there. you can manually  exceute it 


7) or open powershell, then type the paste the below. make usre to chnage the bit from ms-pow..... you need to put the run url of flow. rightclikc on flow and clikc properties and you

would see the run url

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Power Automate Desktop\PAD.Console.Host.exe" "ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?environmentid=8d003e0a-e302-e66f-ad64-74108403dc0e&workflowid=d39e0626-0e34-44de-b326-c5f0c9260aee&source=Other"




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The below two are the most important commands 

The below is what authenticates into power automate service

pac auth create --name 'MyAuthProfile' --environment 'https://orgfd0ed784.crm11.dynamics.com' --username 'cloud_user_p_e8a24d7c@realhandsonlabs.com' --password 'OWl$weJrExQAoV76zOyC'



the below is what sends folder/flow files to power automate service or environment, it doesnt send it to power automate desktop flow but it will reflect under power automate desktop flow later. after
executing the below command successfully, it wil reflect later. you may have to sync or choose environment in your power bi desktop app. 

pac solution import --path "C:\scripts\power-automate-flow-files.zip" --environment https://orgfd0ed784.crm11.dynamics.com



the below is the service principle method, this is having issues like after excetuing this line you may have to add user group or permssion to this service principle 

pac auth create --name MyOrg-SPN --applicationId d01c158e-894a-4855-b650-3f708eaffd3b --clientSecret pSG8Q~lEKESwBPYiWgdvYK6Zme6LePZmfzMxwdcC --tenant 84f1e4ea-8554-43e1-8709-f0b8589ea118


the below is to show the environment url

 pac admin list


 the below is to create a envrionnet 

pac admin create --name 'target-env' --type Trial



the below is to list all the flows in an environment 

Get-AdminFlow -EnvironmentName 93c5b485-a997-e55f-b868-dd6490659501



the below is to list all flows by therir display names 

Get-AdminFlow | Format-Table EnvironmentName, DisplayName, Name
